**Define the desired gameplay**. What are you making?

The gameplay involves two players, each running around and collecting food. Each piece of food gives you one point, whoever collects the most points after 1 minute wins\!

**Outline an objective statement for the design**. What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design? Why?

The gameplay goal that we want is for players to have a lighthearted and slightly competitive experience. The players are meant to want to compete but still have a fun and exciting experience.

**Detail design rationale**. What do you envision? How does this support the overall project/company goal?

We envisioned a game that is slightly chaotic in nature. We envision a game that is meant to be similar to that of a party minigame. Itâ€™s meant to be fast, exciting and easy to grasp. This will serve to be for all audiences and give a universally enjoyable experience.

**Cite all resources, tangible, informative, and transformative**. Cite all resources used in planning and development including the basis project, assets, guides, tutorials, and use of generative AI.

All cooding was done by either ourself or the collaborative efforts of the team. The only part that has any exteneral help was the prefab shooting script and the tag convention.
